					<h2>Welcome to Vizeases</h2>
				</header>
				<p>In the past 5-10 years, diseases which were previously suppressed have begun to re-emerge.  Multiple explanations have been proposed, ranging from a surge in certain bug populations (Lyme disease) to the anti-vaccine movement. Pertussis, or whooping cough, is one of these re-emerging diseases. In 2010, California experienced nearly 10,000 reported whooping cough cases, the highest number it had seen 70 years. In 2014, the national level of whooping cough cases reached more than 48,000, which was higher than any count for the previous 6 decades. Our system uses records of whooping cough cases from Project Tycho data. Project Tycho consists of a large dataset containing all weekly surveillance reports of nationally notifiable diseases for all US cities and states published since 1888. We seek to introduce and explore whooping cough and its re-emergence.</p>
				<p>Data is missing around the 1960s. According to the Project Tycho members, this is because the period from 1956-1974 had such a low number of cases of whooping cough that they did not include this data. Keep in mind that this data is only missing because the number of cases was so low.

					<blockquote>&ldquo;So it's an absolute lie that has killed thousands of kids. Because the mothers who heard that lie, many of them didn't have their kids take either pertussis or measles vaccine, and their children are dead today. And so the people who go and engage in those anti-vaccine efforts - you know, they, they kill children. It's a very sad thing, because these vaccines are important. &rdquo; - Bill Gates</blockquote>
