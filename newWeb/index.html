	<h3>Abstract</h3>
	<p> In the past few years, multiple disease that were once under control are beginning to re-emerge.Pertussis, or whooping cough, is one of these re-emerging diseases. In 2010, California experienced nearly 10,000 reported whooping cough cases, the highest number it had seen 70 years. In 2014, the national level of whooping 
	cough cases reached more than 48,000, which was higher than any count for the previous 6 decades. 
	Project Tycho is a collaborative project at the University of Pittsburgh that consists of a large dataset containing all weekly surveillance reports of nationally notifiable diseases for all US cities and states published since 1888. Thus, our system employed visualizations and user interactions to introduce and explore the re-emergence of Whooping Cough.</p>
